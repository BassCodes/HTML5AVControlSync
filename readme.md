# HTML 5 Audio/Video controls syncer

This simple script makes it easier to use multiple `<audio>` or `<video>` elements on one page while using the browser's implementation of the elements.
The script syncs the volume of all media elements elements, and prevents more than one from playing at once.
The script is a drop in solution. It automatically works with any `<audio controls>` or `<video controls>` tag in your document. 
The script will also persist volume across pages through a cookie.
